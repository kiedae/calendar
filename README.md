## USER STORY ##
As a user i want to be able to use a simple calender to keep track of all my TO-DOs in a work week.

## About the calender ##
The calender shows hours 9am - 5pm and shows past present or future color coded based on the current time. The user can then choose to add TODOS inside the text box and save it.
